Transmitting Humidity Data from Arduino Board

This project focuses on building a smart environmental monitoring system using Arduino, Python, Splunk, and Tableau. By integrating Wi-Fi-enabled IoT devices with data visualization tools, we created a seamless pipeline that captures humidity data, transmits it to a central system, and provides insights through interactive dashboards. To improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary data transmission, we applied Intelligent Edge Network principlesâ€”processing data locally before sending it over the network. This ensures that only meaningful data reaches the server, optimizing network performance and reducing latency.
